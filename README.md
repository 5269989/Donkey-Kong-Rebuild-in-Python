# Donkey Kong Rebuild in Python (Pygame)

## Description

This project is a Python-based recreation of the classic *Donkey Kong* arcade game, built using the Pygame library. Relive the retro fun with dynamic gameplay, custom graphics, and increasing difficulty as you try to rescue the damsel from Donkey Kong's clutches.

## Features

- **Retro Gameplay**: Classic *Donkey Kong* mechanics with jumping, climbing, and avoiding barrels.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Barrels, fireballs, and more to challenge your skills.
- **Multiple Levels**: Progressive challenges with more complex obstacles as you advance.
- **Custom Graphics**: Pixel art design for characters, platforms, and other elements, capturing the essence of the arcade original.
- **Victory & Reset Mechanism**: Complete each level and earn points, but beware of losing lives to barrels and flames.
- **Score System**: Earn points by dodging barrels, defeating fireballs, and completing levels. Bonus points for specific actions.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- **Player Movement**: Use arrow keys to move horizontally and spacebar to jump. Climb ladders and avoid falling.
- **Barrels**: Barrels roll down platforms, and the player must dodge them to survive. Collision with a barrel results in a life lost.
- **Fireballs**: Fireballs spawn from Donkey Kong and must be avoided. The player can temporarily destroy barrels and fireballs using hammers.
- **Victory Condition**: Reach the target platform on each level to progress. Complete all levels.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move left and right.
- **Spacebar**: Jump.
- **Up/Down Arrow Keys**: Climb ladders.
